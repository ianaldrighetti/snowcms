<h1>What is SnowCMS?</h1>
SnowCMS is a content management system written in PHP with database support for MySQL (with SQLite support coming soon), being developed by the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/snowcms/people/list'>SnowCMS Developer Team</a>.</li></ul>

The project is currently in the alpha stage, but development is currently moving along quickly and we will be arriving at the beta stage soon.<br>
<br>
You can monitor what's going on by <a href='http://code.google.com/p/snowcms/source/list'>checking out the changes list</a> along with <a href='http://code.google.com/p/snowcms/source/browse/trunk'>viewing the source of the project</a>.<br>
<br>
If you would like to stay connected you can visit the <a href='http://www.snowcms.com'>SnowCMS blog</a>, <a href='http://dev.snowcms.com/'>the developer forum</a> or <a href='http://www.twitter.com/SnowCMS'>follow us on Twitter</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
The philosophy of the SnowCMS project can be summarized pretty easily: <i>Light, powerful, free. It's all you need, and just that.</i>

Our content management system is very simple with very little features built-in. The idea behind this is to have a robust plugin system to allow many new and useful features to be added on at will. This way websites can have only the features they need and not a bunch of junk that slows the website down and causing more frustration than benefit.<br>

<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
SnowCMS is released under the <a href='http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ms-rl.html'>Microsoft Reciprocal License</a>, allowing you to modify and redistribute it at your will! The MS-RL requires that the original source code be released under the same (MS-RL) license, however modifications made may be released under a different license.<br>
<br>
If you want to get involved with development, it is best that you check out the <a href='http://dev.snowcms.com/'>developer forum</a> to converse with the the main developers of SnowCMS. It is also a good idea to become familiar with the ins and outs of SnowCMS by checking out the <a href='http://snowcms.googlecode.com/svn/docs/index.html'>documentation</a>.<br>
<br>
We are always looking for people interested in the following:<br>
<br>
<b>Themes</b>

Creating themes for SnowCMS 2.0 is very easy to do. While we currently do not have any documentation or tutorials on how to do so, you can <a href='http://code.google.com/p/snowcms/source/browse/trunk#trunk%2Fthemes%2Fdefault'>check out the current default theme</a> to get an idea of how to create a theme.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Plugins</b>

With very few default features in SnowCMS, it is nothing without plugins, other than a member system. So we need people who are interested in learning the ins and outs of the <a href='http://snowcms.googlecode.com/svn/docs/files/core/api-class-php.html'>API</a> and other <a href='http://snowcms.googlecode.com/svn/docs/index.html'>tools</a> available to developers. This way they can be of help to other developers to get them going on creating great plugins for the SnowCMS community to enjoy -- or so they can create plugins of their own. We also need people to have an eye out on the code as well, to tell us "Hey, you should put a hook there to allow XYZ" or "A filter there" or other things like that to allow the maximum extensibility of SnowCMS.<br>
<br>
<b>Translators</b>

Currently this isn't a very biggy, but soon, it will be. Once SnowCMS starts to come together, we want to be sure to have a huge set of translation available for people to use. Translators would need to be fluent in English and, of course, another language so they can translate text for SnowCMS.<br>
<br>
<b>System developers</b>

SnowCMS used to have 2 developers, but currently only I (ian.aldrighetti) am developing the system (though getting input and ideas from a few others). It would be nice to some day have more than one developer working on SnowCMS. But of course, I need to be able to trust you with privileges not many others have. So you will need to start building the trust of the team by creating plugins and such.<br>
