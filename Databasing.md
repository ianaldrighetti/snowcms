# Introduction to databasing #
SnowCMS supports multiple types of database systems, in order to do so we use a database class, which implements the interface Database. In the implementation of Database, the class is allowed to do whatever is needed to ensure the query runs as expected, so team members and developers alike must use the $db object to do anything relating to databasing.

# Details #
In the source code of SnowCMS, all queries are written in MySQL correct syntax. More information coming soon!
